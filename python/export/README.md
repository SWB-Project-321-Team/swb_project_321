# python/export/

Scripts that produce **client-facing and internal deliverables** and write them to OneDrive `02_outputs/`.

- CSV/Excel exports, summary tables, list exports → `02_outputs/exports/` or `02_outputs/tables/`.
- Figures, charts, maps → `02_outputs/figures/`.
- Report generation or assembly → `02_outputs/report/` (draft or final).

Read from OneDrive curated (or database); write only to `02_outputs/`. No data or credentials in repo.
