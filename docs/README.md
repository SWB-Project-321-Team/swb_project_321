# docs/

Project documentation (methodology, data sources, structure, and decisions). Lives in the repo with the code.

- **OneDrive_Structure.md** — How OneDrive and GitHub fit together; folder layout and rules.
- **methodology.md** — Analytical approach, definitions, and assumptions.
- **data_sources.md** — Data sources, provenance, and refresh.
- **benchmark_regions.md** — How benchmark regions are chosen and where outputs live.
- **decisions.md** — Architecture and process decisions (ADRs or notes).

Data-specific docs (e.g. data dictionary, limitations) live in OneDrive `03_docs/` next to the data.
