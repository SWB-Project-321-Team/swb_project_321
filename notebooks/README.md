# notebooks/

Jupyter notebooks for **analysis and communication**. Exploratory and narrative; not the main ETL pipeline.

- Read from OneDrive curated data (Parquet) or the optional `01_data/database/` copy.
- Summaries, visualizations, benchmark comparisons, and draft narrative for reports.
- Use `01_`, `02_`, etc. for order; keep example/template notebooks (e.g. `*_example.ipynb`) for onboarding.

Do not commit data or credentials. Notebooks are for exploration and storytelling; production pipelines live in `python/` and `sql/`.
