# SWB Project 321

This repository contains the **code, SQL, and analytical logic** for *Statistics Without Borders (SWB) Project 321*, which analyzes IRS Form 990 filings to profile and benchmark nonprofit landscapes in the **Black Hills region** and comparable peer regions.

The project supports SWB’s mission to provide pro bono statistical and data science support to nonprofit organizations.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Build a clear, data-driven profile of the nonprofit ecosystem in the Black Hills region
- Compare nonprofit scale, composition, and financial capacity against selected benchmark regions
- Deliver transparent, reproducible analysis and analysis-ready datasets to the client

The analysis is based primarily on **IRS Form 990 filings** (Forms 990, 990-EZ, and 990-PF), supplemented with geographic reference data and U.S. Census context.

---

## Architecture (Separation of Concerns)

This project intentionally separates **code**, **data**, and **outputs**:

| Component | Location |
|---|---|
| Code & analysis logic | **GitHub (this repository)** |
| Raw & curated data | **OneDrive** |
| Analysis outputs | **OneDrive (CSV / Excel / report)** |

⚠️ **No raw or curated data is stored in this repository.**

---

## Data Policy

- Raw source data (IRS 990 extracts, Census data) live in **OneDrive**
- Curated, analysis-ready datasets are versioned and stored in **OneDrive**
- This repository contains **no CSVs, Parquet files, Excel files, or credentials**
- All local paths and secrets are environment-specific and excluded via `.gitignore`
